For This Project my first idea was to model orbital dynamics in the end I didn't have much time as I wanted to create a model in which the masses
are not too different from each other, my model works for smaller masses, considering the central plannet is more massive than the orbiting planet
However it starts acting erratically as we scale. Thus i changed my project and modeled the brownian motion path of a stock with the intent of 
creating a model that is able to make predictions of the future of the sctock then see how these algorithms perform compared to each other.

That being said, I would like to be grade on the notebook tittled FinalProject_480, but i also provided the previous project files in case you wanted to look at it
you could run either the "modeling_2d" or "modeling_3d" i've worked mostly on the 2D model they pull from a script file where i created the respective classes and routines.

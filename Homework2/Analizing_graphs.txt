The plot of the relative error between the integration technique and the number of intervals
for Milne's and Simpson's method included 2 regions. The relative error for both would decrease linearly(and we can see that clearly on a log-log plot)
The relative error change to mostly noise afterwards. The linear relationship for Simpson's method had a slope of  approximately -4.0, which tells us that the relative error decreases like N^-4 with the number of intervals. For Milne's method,
the slope was approximatelly -6.1, which tells us that the relative error decreases like N^-6 with the number of intervals. 

looking at the graph, the optimum number of points should be ~1.39e19. which is less points than what the simpson algorithm requires

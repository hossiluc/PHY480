# Grading Scale: check(+) --> excellent codes and analysis
                 check    --> satisfactory (missing small gaps in analysis or codes)
                 check(-) --> unsatisfactory (significant problems with codes/analysis or incomplete)  

The results look like something is wrong. The slope for the Milne integration should be steeper than Simpson's, since
it's a higher order method than Simpson's rule. (Also, the slope of the Simpson's rule *should* be 
closer to -4, I would think.) There are 2 possibilities that you should investigate 

1) The Milne algorithm might simply be coded incorrectly
2) I noticed your code is mixing floats and doubles all over the place, which is dangerous since you're 
mixing different precisions. Make sure you're using all doubles.
3) Your test function sqrt(x)*Sin(x) has a branch cut singularity at 0 (see the notes and supplementary 
handout where the integration of singular functions is discussed). This is a rather weak singularity, 
since nothing is "blowing up". But still, you might try a singularity-free integrand
like x*sin(x) or something. 

Suggestion 1) might take the longest, so I'd try 2) and 3) first. If you at least try 2) and 3)(even if it doesn't fix
your Milne results), i'll bump you up to a check.  
  
Grade: check(-)

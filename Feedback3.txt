Grades:  check(-) :  some major problems with the codes and/or analysis
         check    :  good (with some minor gaps in your results/analysis) 
         check(+) :  excellent 
         check(++) : excellent with one of the BONUS problems completed

Revised grade: check(-)

the HO wavefunction multiplying the expansion coefficient be varying with each term in the sum or not?)

Analysis:

Under the assumption that `gsl_sf_bessel_jl()` is more accurate than either the
downward or the upward recursion.

From the plots we can see that for  0 < x < 10 the downward recursion is more
accurate that the upward recursion up to about machine error precision epsilon (which is about 1e-16).

For 0 < x < 1, upward recursion is very innaccurate, and for 1 < x < 10 it follows a power law with the
relative error proportional to x^-17. For 10 < x < 30, both upward and downward recursion are
equally accurate up to machine epsilon. Only after x>30 (For 30 < x < 100), the upward recursion is more accurate the
downward recursion, and for 30 < x < 40 the relative error of downward recursion is proportional to x^75.

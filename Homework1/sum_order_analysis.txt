Analysis:

When we look at the plot generated by using the output of this algorithm we see that the upward (1->N) and downward (N->1) sums are mostly equal until the number of
terms is approximatelly 2e4. For what I can tell, the two methods keep diverging easily until the number of terms is about 2e5. 

We see from the near significant divergence plot that the "oscillations" in the relative error
are due to the values of the upward sum diverging from the upward sum erratically and intersecting it at certain points. 

The upward sum slope decrease a litle at about 2e6 terms. Which makes me belive that the upward sum is a less accurate method, which is indeed what
what we would expect.

When summing upward, we start with a large number '1' and progressively add smaller and smaller numbers; 
the relative difference between the sum and the next term to add becomes increasingly larger, thus making further additions less accurate.
The saturation occurs when this relative difference is greater than 1 + machine epsilon.

Assuming this is the case, then with N=(number of terms) the slopes in the relative error
plot tell us that for 0 < N < 2e4 the relative error of the upward sum is proportional to N^0.38.
